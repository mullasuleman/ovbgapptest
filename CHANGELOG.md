	ADDED:
	- animation duration, svg path length and repeat
	   properties inside a 3d array, initially just
            the svg path was id inside an array (parkFeautre[].paths[]). Now, each path can have different animation duration, length and repeat value. If needed in future we can add width-size and colour as well.
	TempFixed:
	  -When start and from locations are the
	    same, icons circles of the location will animate once and clear after (i.e go back to their old state),  in case of Memory Garden there was no circle around it so the Memory Garden icon.
